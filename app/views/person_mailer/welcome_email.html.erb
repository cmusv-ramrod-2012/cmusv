What You Need To Know About Your CMU-SV Email Address
</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whenever you have to enter both your CMU-SV email address and password on a page with a URL ending in "google.com" (or, for server settings in an email app),
    <br/>you MUST use: <%= switch_sv_to_west(@person.email) %>
  </li>
  <li>
    BUT, we identify ourselves as "@sv.cmu.edu", and use that form everywhere else.
  </li>
</ul>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>

      <li>
        Your temporary password:  <%= @password %>

    </ul>
  <li>
    Choose "Settings" (in the Gmail browser interface) from the Gear Wheel pull-down.

  </li><li>
    Uncheck the "Treat as an alias" checkbox.

    Click "Next Step".
  </li><li>
    The dialog box should dismiss, and "<%= @person.email %>" should be added to "Send mail as".
  </li><li>
    Click the "make default" link to its right.
  </li>
</ol>
<p/>
In email apps, specify "@<b>west</b>.cmu.edu" for server logons (possibly under advanced settings), but use "@<b>sv</b>.cmu.edu" for user information address and "Reply-To" settings.
